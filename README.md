# Statistical_Analysis

We demonstrate how various descriptive and inferential statistical methods can be applied to the NBA dataset for the season 2014-2015 to get useful insights from the data. We study two main factors that can affect the outcome of a game, the home-court advantage and the rest days between the games. Both of them show that they significantly affecting the outcome of the game for the home team but do not indicate the same for the away team.  Also, we give some insight for the two factors at the teams level.
